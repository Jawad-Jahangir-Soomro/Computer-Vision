# Computer-Vision

1st Year Second Semester Project

This repository contains my 1st year second semester project, where I applied my computer science knowledge to tackle a real-world problem. 
This project was a great opportunity for me to deepen my understanding of various concepts and hone my skills in a hands-on setting.
I am excited to share my project with the world and hope it will serve as a useful resource for others in the field.

Introduction

This repository contains a project on computer vision, with a focus on Text Recognition, Face Detection, and Face Recognition.
The project is developed using a combination of programming languages and libraries, including Java, Python, OpenCV, Tesseract, FreeTTS, HaarCascade, and Dlib.

Text Recognition

The Text Recognition section of the project uses the Tesseract OCR library, along with FreeTTS, OpenCV, and Java. 
The aim of this section is to accurately recognize text from images.

Face Detection

The Face Detection section of the project uses the OpenCV library and the HaarCascade algorithm. The aim of this section is to detect faces Live.

Face Recognition

The Face Recognition section of the project uses OpenCV, Dlib, and HaarCascade. 
The aim of this section is to accurately recognize faces in real-time. This section is implemented in Python.

Requirements

To run this project, you will need to have the following software installed on your system:

Java
Python
OpenCV
Tesseract
FreeTTS
Dlib
